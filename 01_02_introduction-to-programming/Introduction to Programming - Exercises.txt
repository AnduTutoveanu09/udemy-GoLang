Introduction to Programming
Problems maked with * are “stretch problems”. They will challenge you to do some research on your own and learn something new in order to solve them.
Problem 01 - Hello World
Create a program, which prints on the terminal the message “Hello World!”.


Example:
Hello World!
	Problem 02 - Print your name
Create a new Go project in your IDE and write a simple program which prints your name in the terminal. Write all the code from scratch, don’t use any templates out of the box.
Problem 03 - Print your name and age
Create a program, which prints your first and last names on the terminal, followed by your age.


Example:
My name is Linus Torvalds.
My age is 50.
	Problem 04 - Print the numbers from 1 to 10
Create a program, which prints the numbers from 1 to 10.


Example:
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10
	Problem 05* - Raise 2 to the power of 11
Create a program, which calculates 2 to the power of 11. Don’t just calculate it with a calculator & print the result. Instead, try doing the calculation in your program.


For this problem, you’ll have to do some research on your own. Try googling “how to calculate the power of two numbers in golang”.


Example:
2048
	

Problem 06* - Print the numbers from 1 to 1000
Create a program, which prints the numbers from 1 to 1000. The numbers should be printed on different lines. For this problem, you will have to do some research in order to avoid having to print them all by hand.


Hint: learn about for loops in golang


Some of the output is omitted in the example below.


Example:
1
2
3
...
998
999
1000
	

Problem 07* - Generate a random number from 0 to 10
Create a go program which generates a random number between 0 and 10 inclusively. Print the number on the terminal


Every time you run the program, a different number should be shown.


Example:
7
	

Note: the output can differ on your end as it’s expected for it to be random.
Problem 08* - Print the current date
Create a program which prints the current date to the terminal.


The format of the output can differ on your end. It’s the correct date that is important.


Example:
2021-01-03 12:51:57.696855 +0200 EET m=+0.000138399
